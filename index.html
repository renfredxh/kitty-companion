<h2>Kitty Companions</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
  Help kittens make friends to save Valentines Day.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
  Lightheartedly challenged.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
  Puzzle/strategy.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
  You can click on kittens as they appear on-screen and their interests (likes/dislikes) will show up on the right side of the game. As more kittens appear, you should drag them together to match up their interests as closely as possible. Having matching likes per pair of kittens will help you gain points, but having conflicting likes and dislikes will make you lose points, so watch out. The demo wins when you have 30 points, and if you reach 0 points you lose.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
  It's sort of a hybrid of puzzle and strategy. You have to piece like things together, but it's more free-form ,abstract and has some elements of randomness
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
  It's almost Valentines day and you're Cupid. You thought you matched up every living being on the plant but realized you forgot to match cats! Help these kittens find friends they can have a nice time with on Valentines day, or else it'll be ruined forever.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
  All audiences
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
  A few minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
  Not trying to match kittens right away, but waiting a bit. Each kitten that appears has a matching optimal kitten waiting in the queue to appear in the future. It's not always clear which one is the optimal one so you have to take risks sometimes to avoid having too many kittens on the screen and them running into each other.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
  Sprites from open sprite resource. Cat pictures from Google. Music from Sim City. Cat noises from open sound effects websites.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing from a Phaser Example, you must say so here.
